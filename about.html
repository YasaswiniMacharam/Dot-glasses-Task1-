        <h1>About Dot Glasses</h1>
        <p class="tagline">Transforming lives through revolutionary, affordable, and accessible eyecare.</p>
        <p>
          Dot Glasses was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to eliminate poor vision globally by making eyewear accessible, affordable, and innovative. More than <strong>1 billion people</strong> around the world suffer from vision problems simply because they don‚Äôt have access to eye care or cannot afford glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe everyone deserves clear sight, and that belief drives us to deliver innovative solutions like our patented adjustable lenses and self-test eye kits ‚Äî eliminating the need for expensive eye care services and making glasses universally accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team works closely with NGOs, schools, and governments to distribute glasses efficiently in underserved areas ‚Äî ensuring that no one is left behind due to poor eyesight.
